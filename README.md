# Background
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."
But, if pressed, how would you prove it?


# Obserations
Some things that stood out while looking at the data seem to indicate that the further north you go from the center, the temperature drops extremly quick. On the other hand the places higher while the center is hotter the chnages in temp, are not as drastic.
Humidity data doesn't really show us much in difference as the data shows it is all over the place.
The clouds also vary not really showing a pattern in terms of lattiude.
Winds also seem to be low and not really change much, from all the data gathered we can mostly see the biggest change from all is the Temp.
